# AnnualWeatherTracker
This program uses a weather data set of Fremont for an entire year. The program provides users with information (i.e. prints the information according to the user's preference for temperature and precipitation scales)

The purpose of this program is to prompt the user to enter a temperature scale value of either Fahrenheit (F or f) or Celsius (C or c). 
In addition, we prompt the user to enter a precipitation scale value of either Inches or Centimeters. 
Based on the user's input, we will need to print the results. 

For this program, we will need to print the average monthly temperature and precipitation values for a city located in Florida. 
We will need to covert the temperature to Celsius and precipitation to cm. 
Towards the end, we will have needed to utilize the printf concept to format our output in a user-friendly manner. 

Main points: We needed to include two static methods which needed to have been called in order for our program to work. 
We would've also needed to include loops to traverse the arrays. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Area for improvement: 
Overall, I struggled to understand how we could've implemented two static methods in our program as my program was working fine without them. 
However, I understood the importance of writing good code. Regardless of whether my program worked or not, I needed to ensure I included all concepts taught. 

What I liked:
I enjoyed writing this program because I was able to utilize many concepts to solve a problem: converting temperatures and precipitation. 
The idea of working with numbers has always enthralled me!
